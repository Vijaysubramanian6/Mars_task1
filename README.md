Hello !!!!!!. The above three files(cpp) are my mars task 1 files, mini project files. These can be run in tinkercad(which i have tried running it on) and in arduino IDE (mostly).

Basic idea/concept of the projects

Solar Move: This project is the concept of Solar that adjusts it self in the direction on sunlight to maximise its efficiency. Here a solar planel is to be placed on the servo, which based on data collected by the LDR
sensors changes it direction to align it self in direction of falling sunlight. 

Gesture Control: It shows the concept of a gesture controlled movable object, maybe car. Here i am controlling a motor using my gesture of hand.(Controlling its direction of rotation and speed). The gestrue is 
tracked using flex and tilt sensor. 

Liquid Density: Trying to find desity of a liquid using force and ultrasonics sensor. Concept- taking a liquid in a container with force sensor placed at the bottom of the container, such that it can measure the
force exerted by the liquid. The ultrasonic sensor will calculate the height of the liquid(height of the container is known). I know the height of liquid column  and the weight of the liquid column, with which i can 
find the density.


Will shortly upload the video of the simulation.
